* The essence of good code
* True for all languages

Note:
Not software patterns


# What?

\- Albert Einstein

Note:
Rules are meant to be broken

---

# Rule 1: Readable
- Code is read more than it's written
- Less code is more readable
- Use good names and variables to make the intent clear

---

# Rule 2: DRY
- Don't Repeat Yourself
- Code must never be duplicated
- Copying and pasting is banned
- Think "How many files/functions would need to change if I changed this?"

---

# Rule 3: Testable
- Test your code
- If you can't write tests for it, don't write it
- Prevent recurring bugs by adding tests
- Test your assumptions (especially the libraries you use)
- Changes to the code should require a change to the tests
- Think "If I change this code, what tests would break?", if the answer is none, add more tests.

---

# Rule 4: Refactor
- If you change it, make it better
- Prevent software atrophy
- Good code, begets good code

---

# Rule 5: Automate
- If it's worth doing, it worth automating
- Automate all regular tasks
- Avoid any process that requires clicking (very hard to automate clicks)
- Makes using Continuous Integration a lot easier
- e.g. building, testing, deploying, infrastructure, backups
